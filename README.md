# Guide

The PostgresSQL transition guide was the result of collaborative work within the French administration. Its objective is to answer questions regarding the implementation of PostgreSQL as a replacement for a commercial solution. This guide is now opensource, welcomes contributions and is under the PostgreSQL license.

# History

In 2013, a first draft was produced by several opensource workgroups from French Ministries. In 2015, the first version was released. The same year, a Russian version was made available by I. Panchenko and O. Bartunov. Members of the PGGTIE (a group of companies under the PostgreSQL FR umbrella) updated the document in 2019 and decided to release it in English in 2021. This English version is now PostgreSQL licensed as a small gift to the PostgreSQL community.
